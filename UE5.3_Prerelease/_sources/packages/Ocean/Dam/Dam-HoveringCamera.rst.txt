Dam-HoveringCamera
=============================

This scenario starts with a HoveringAUV near the actual dam. This is identical to the base version, only with cameras mounted.
Unless otherwise specified, all sensors are named the same as their class name, ie IMUSensor is named "IMUSensor".

- ``auv0``: Main :ref:`HoveringAUV <hovering-auv-agent>` agent
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.IMUSensor` configured with noise, bias, and returns bias.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.GPSSensor` gets measurements with N(1, 0.25) of the surface, actual measurement also has noise.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.DVLSensor` configured with an elevation of 22.5 degrees, noise, and returns 4 range measurements.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RGBCamera` named LeftCamera.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.RGBCamera` named RightCamera.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.DepthSensor` configured with noise.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.PoseSensor` for ground truth.
    - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.VelocitySensor` for ground truth.
