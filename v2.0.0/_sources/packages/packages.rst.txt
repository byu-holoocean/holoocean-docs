HoloOcean Packages
==================

A holoocean package contains one or more worlds, which each have one or more scenarios.
A scenario is a specific configuration of a world, including agents, sensors, and other settings. 
Packages contain predefined scenarios for convenience, but worlds can be used with user-defined 
scenarios as well.

The Oceans package is the default package installed with HoloOcean. It contains three primary worlds, 
each with several scenarios for convenient use.
