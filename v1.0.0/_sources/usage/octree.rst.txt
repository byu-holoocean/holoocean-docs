.. _`octree`:


Octree Generation
=========================

When running an environment with a sonar sensor, octrees must be
generated. These can often take up several gigabytes of storage, thus
aren't feasible as part of the downloaded package.

Upon startup, all octrees within the ``InitOctreeRange`` parameter are created, 
then more are made as the agent moves throughout the environment. This can cause pauses
in the simulation the first time it is ran. A warning will appear onscreen about this
and can be disabled with the ``ShowWarning`` parameter. All subsequent simulation runs
will use the cached octrees and run much faster. 

One option to avoid waiting times, is to run the simulation without the viewport, and 
let it generate octrees in the background. Here's an example script that does exactly that,
just change the scenario to the one that you would like to create octrees for,

::

    import holoocean
    import numpy as np
    from tqdm import tqdm

    command = np.array([0,0,0,0,-20,-20,-20,-20])
    print("Building octrees...")
    with holoocean.make("PierHarbor-HoveringImagingSonar", show_viewport=False) as env:
        for i in tqdm(range(1000)):
            env.act("auv0", command)
            state = env.tick()

    print("Finished Simulation")


When octrees are made, they are saved in the :ref:`package-locations` in an octree folder. 
This will be as follows, 

========== ==================================================================================================================
 Platform   Octree Save Location
========== ==================================================================================================================
Linux      ``~/.local/share/holoocean/{holoocean_version}/worlds/{world_name}/LinuxNoEditor/Holodeck/Octrees``
Windows    ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\holoocean\{holoocean_version}\worlds\{world_name}\WindowsNoEditor\Holodeck\Octrees``
========== ==================================================================================================================

In this octree folder, there will be additional folders for each level name, and in those a folder for each
octree size used. If files are being actively saved here it means that the simulation is still running
and isn't frozen.
