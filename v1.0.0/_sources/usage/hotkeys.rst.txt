Viewport Hotkeys
================

When the viewport window is open, and the environment is being ticked (with 
calls to :meth:`~holoocean.environment.HoloOceanEnvironment.tick` or
:meth:`~holoocean.environment.HoloOceanEnvironment.step`, there are a few
hotkeys you can use.

The AgentFollower, or the camera that the viewport displays, can be 
manipulated as follows:

+----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Key      | Action                | Description                             |

| ``c``    | Toggle camera mode    | Toggles the camera from a chase camera  |
|          |                       | and perspective camera, which shows what|
|          |                       | the agent's camera sensor sees.         |
+----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``v``    | Toggle spectator mode | Toggles spectator mode, which allows you|
|          |                       | to free-cam around the world.           |
+----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+

|          |                       | cycles through the agents in the world  |
+----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``h``    | Toggle HUD            | The HUD displays the name and location  |
|          |                       | of the agent the viewport is following, |
|          |                       | or the location of the camera if the    |
|          |                       | viewport is detached (spectator mode)   |
|          |                       |                                         |
|          |                       | Note that this will interfere with the  |
|          |                       | ViewportCapture sensor                  |
