Description
-----------
Our custom in-house hovering AUV.

See the :class:`~holoocean.agents.HoveringAUV`.

Control Schemes
---------------

**AUV Thrusters (``0``)**
  An 8-length floating point vector used to specify the control on each thruster. They begin with the front right vertical thrusters, then goes around counter-clockwise, then repeat the last four with the sideways thrusters.

**PD Controller (``1``)**
   A 6-length floating point vector of desired position in the global frame and roll, pitch, and yaw. A basic PD controller has been implementing to move the vehicle to that position and orientation using the needed forces and torques.

**Custom Dynamics (``2``)**
   A 6-length floating point vector of linear and angular accelerations in the global frame. This is to be used for implementing custom dynamics. Besides collisions, all other forces and torques - including gravity, buoyancy, and damping - have been disabled in the simulator to allow for a clean slate for custom dynamics.

Sockets
-------

- ``COM`` Center of mass
- ``DVLSocket`` Location of the DVL
- ``IMUSocket`` Location of the IMU. Rotated 180 on x axis, i.e. in a NED frame instead of NWU.
- ``DepthSocket`` Location of the depth sensor.
- ``SonarSocket`` Location of the sonar sensor.
- ``CameraRightSocket`` Location of the right camera (when looking in the same direction that the AUV is facing).
- ``CameraLeftSocket`` Location of the left camera (when looking in the same direction that the AUV is facing).
- ``Origin`` true center of the robot
- ``Viewport`` where the robot is viewed from.
