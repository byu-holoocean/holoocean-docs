.. Changelog Style Guide
  - Each release should have a New Features / Changes / Bug Fixes section.
  - Keep the first sentence of each point short and descriptive
  - The passive voice should be avoided
  - Try to make the first word a verb in past tense. Bug fixes should use
    "Fixed"
  - Add a link to the issue describing the change or the pull request that
    merged it at the end in parentheses
  - see https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/wiki/Holodeck-Release-Notes-Template

HoloOcean 2.0.0
===============
*5/10/2025*

New Features
------------
- Improved rendering with Unreal Engine 5.3
- Advanced vehicle dynamics using models from Fossen

Large sonar upgrade!

Highlights
----------
- 3 new sonar sensors
- Upgraded noise modeling in Imaging and Profiling Sonar
- Lots of misc bug fixes!
- Upgrade to Unreal Engine 4.27

New Features
------------
- Added many new sonar sensors, including

  - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.ImagingSonar`
  - :class:`~holoocean.sensors.SidescanSonar`

Changes
-------
- SonarSensor is now ImagingSonar
- Rotations are now a correct [roll, pitch, yaw]
- Step function no longer returns terminal, reward and info. Only state
- Environments no longer publish over lcm in pre-start ticks

Bug Fixes
---------
- Timeouts are turned off for sonars to prevent premature termination of the simulation
- Specifying a number of ticks to execute at once now ticks for all of them
