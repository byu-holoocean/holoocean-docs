Developing HoloOcean
====================

.. note::
   
   HoloOcean has updated from using Unreal Engine 4.27 to 5.3. If you are developing worlds, agents, 
   sensors, etc. using Unreal, you will need to download Unreal Engine 5.3 to develop from the 
   current release and develop branches. Unreal Engine 4.27 usage is still available using previous 
   releases of HoloOcean. 

For users that would like to add to or modify HoloOcean, this documentation will help you get started.

The following guides go through how to set up your development environment, including Unreal 
Engine, and how to add new environments, agents, and sensors.

.. We've tried to be thorough here, but there may be a bit more information to be had by 
.. navigating through `holodeck's documentation <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/wiki/Packaging-Project>`_.
