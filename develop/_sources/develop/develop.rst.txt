Developing HoloOcean
====================

For users that would like to add to or modify HoloOcean, this documentation will help you get started.

The following guides go through how to set up your development environment, including Unreal 
Engine, and how to add new environments, agents, and sensors.

.. We've tried to be thorough here, but there may be a bit more information to be had by 
.. navigating through `holodeck's documentation <https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/holodeck/wiki/Packaging-Project>`_.
